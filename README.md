# Regression_Problem
on this work, i had a data of temperature and pressure. i was asked to choose any algorithm to use 
from supervised machine learning algo for regression problems
like linear regression, support vector regression, polynomial regression. which will fit the data 
among those algorithm, polynomial model is the best becouse it fit in data well by using visualization
